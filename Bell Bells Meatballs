Optional Ingredients:

Process:

Preheat Oven to 375
Combine all ingredients.  Mix just enough to combine.  Should feel kinda slimy and gross.
Let sit for 10 minutes ( dont skip this, ingredients need to absorb the milk)
Form golf ball sized meatballs on tray.  I suggest lining the tray with Parchment paper.
Bake in oven for 22-30 minutes (until MB temp 165-170)



Heat cast iron Comal, Pan, or Griddle to between 350-375F
Add remaining wet ingredients
Add all remaining ingredients and simmer 30-60 minutes, uncovered.
