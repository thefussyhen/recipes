Note: See tips if you dont have Buttermilk!

Yield: This is a half batch, and yields approximatly four 8 inch pancakes

Wet Ingredients:

1 cup (454g) Buttermilk
1/2 large egg
1 tablespoon (12g) vegetable oil
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Dry Ingredients:

1 cups (120g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
3 tablespoons malted milk powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Optional:

Choclate chips or other mix-ins if desired

Process:

Heat cast iron Comal, Pan, or Griddle to between 350-375F.  See notes.
If you dont have Sourmilk, make it 10 minutes before you begin
Add all remaining ingredients, let stand for 5-10 minutes.
Use a 1/2 cup ladle to drop up to, or just shy of 1/2 cup of batter onto the Comal. Start a stopwatch.
At 1:30, flip the pancake.  at 3:00, it should be done.   See Tips.

Tips:

To make substitute buttermilk, combine one tablespoon of Vinegar or Lemon juice with one per cup of milk and let stand for 10 minutes.

Keep the spatula and comal clean, and keep the comal lightly oiled between pancakes. Make sure the temp is where you want it at all times before adding a pancake.  A clean pan and spatula will help keeping things from sticking.  Before each pancake, I lightly wipe the oil on and off with a paper towel. The pan should be shiny, but there should not be visible droplets of oil present.  If the pancakes stick, your pan is probally not hot enough, or you simply tried to turn them too soon.  Use a large metal spatula.

If you aren't used to working with a cast iron comal, you will find your temp dial needs to be much lower than you expect.  My temp is set at 1.6, on a scale of 1-7.  This will heat the pan up slowly, and keep the temp wher I want it while I cook the pancakes.  If I am not cooking, an empty comal will eventually overheat even at this low setting, so keep an eye on it.  If it starts smoking, its too hot.  Cast iron loves to run away form you and get way too hot way too fast if your temp is set too high.

If your temps are well controlled, you can reliably cook by stopwatch.  However, its worth leaning to watch the pancakes to see how they look when they are ready.  You will know they are ready to flip when they start to look more like a solid than a liquid.  Bubbles will probally form and pop, and the pancake might steam a little.  If you look very closley at the bottom edge, you will see places that are looking a little crispy.  After the flip,  watch the bottom edge for browning.  Dont lift it up... once you do it will never brown more, just look carefully and find a place where you can see a tiny bit of the pancake where the batter is touching the pan.  Thats the spot you can watch like a hawk. When you see its getting good and brown, the pancake is probally finihsed.   Trust temp and time at first, but as you make more pancakes watch thse things too so you know what to look for when you inevitably forget to set your stopwatch.
