Prep:  12 minutes  Bake:  12 minutes  Total:  36 minute
Yield:  3 dozen cookies


Dry Ingredients:
    2/3 cup (142g) light brown sugar.  I only pack it if I cant weigh it.
    2/3 cup (131g) granulated sugar
    3/4 teaspoon table salt, (use 1/2 teaspoon salt if you use salted butter)
    1 teaspoon baking soda

    1/2 cup (92g) vegetable shortening
    2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract
    1/4 teaspoon almond extract, optional
    1 teaspoon cider vinegar or white vinegar
    1 large egg

Add Last:
    2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
    2 cups (340g) semisweet chocolate chips*

*For cookies with extra chocolate in every bite, use up to 16 ounces (2 2/3 cups) chocolate chips.

Equipment:

Deep mixing bowl.  ( I use the one from a Kitchenaid )
Hand Mixer
Two large cookie sheets
Parchment Paper ( Or lightly grease the pans like a monstor )
Cookie scoop or spoon for portioning
Cooling Racks


Process:

Preheate Oven to 375f
Parchment Paper on 2 baking sheets
Combine sugars,  butters,  shortening, salt, extracts, vinegar, baking soda.  Beat until smooth and creamy.
Beat in Egg unti smooth and creamy
Mix in Flour, then chips

Portion 1.25" balls of dough onto sheets, leave 2" between each.
Option:  Sprinkle with Sea Salt
Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until edges are chestnut brown and their tops are light golden brown, almost blonde.

Cool on pan for a few minute or two, then transfer parchment to cooling racks.




Note on Brown Sugar:  
  I always just make it on demand.  One tablespoon of Molassas to one cup of Sugar for light brown sugar.  Corn oil the spoon to get the molassas to release.
